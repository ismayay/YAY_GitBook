# How to KYC?

Ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of our platform isn't just a priorityâ€”it's a commitment. Our KYC (Know Your Customer) processes, though they might seem stringent, are meticulously designed to safeguard every member of our community.&#x20;

**Here's why they matter:**

**Identity Verification:** It's vital for us to know who's joining our community. We actively verify user identities to ensure our platform remains free from malicious entities and to protect you from potential risks.

**Sanctions & Watchlist Checks:** To maintain a clean slate and a reputable platform, we screen all users against global sanctions lists. This ensures we're not inadvertently providing a platform for those involved in activities like illegal warfare, terrorism, or corruption.

**Onchain Wallet Checks (KYT):** By screening wallet addresses against crypto-specific sanction lists, we ensure that our platform remains a haven from potentially harmful crypto interactions.

**Politically Exposed Person (PEP) Assessment:** PEPs can sometimes pose unforeseen risks. We evaluate users for ties to PEPs not to discriminate, but to comprehend the broader context and manage potential risks.

**Real-Time Monitoring:** By continuously updating our user profiles, we can act swiftly if new compliance issues emerge, ensuring our platform's integrity remains intact.



Your trust is our most valued asset. By implementing these KYC practices, we aim to provide a secure, transparent, and trustworthy environment for all our users. Together, we're forging a safer and more inclusive future in the crypto space.
