# $YAY Tokenomics

The YAY Tokenomics is designed to foster a sustainable and equitable ecosystem for all stakeholders. With a total supply of 1 billion YAY tokens, our allocation strategy prioritizes community engagement, ecosystem growth, and long-term value creation. Each allocation is carefully planned with defined lock-ups and release schedules to maintain token stability and transparency.

This repository provides a detailed breakdown of the YAY token allocation, vesting schedules, and initial circulating supply at launch.
