# OTC Marketplace

The OTC Marketplace stands as one of the most powerful tools within the YAY Network Launchpad. In this space, you can list your allocations for sale or make public proposals, allowing seamless interactions and deals with fellow users.

**Sellers Page**

On the 'Sellers' page, you'll find all sales listings from other users. Displayed information includes the **size of the allocation they're selling**, at the PSO rate, and a green figure indicating the **total deal amount**. The **multiplier** showcases the profit the user is aiming to gain from the deal. Think you can strike a better deal? Use the '**negotiate**' option, which opens up a direct chat with the seller for straightforward negotiations.

For a safe and transparent experience, we strongly advise that even if you agree upon a different price in the chat, you execute the transaction on the platform. This ensures that your P2P transfer is protected by our robust smart contracts, guaranteeing that both parties honor their agreements.

**Buyers Page:**

Contrary to the 'Sellers' page, the 'Buyers' page lets you showcase your offers for any token registered on the platform. Similarly, the token associated with a proposal is displayed on the left.&#x20;

The initial value illustrates the size of the deal at the PSO rate, while the green figure below indicates the total deal value. The multiplier once again sheds light on the deal's profitability, but remember, you always have room to negotiate the price!

We regard the OTC Marketplace as one of our most powerful tools, and we're keen for you to experience its full breadth. At the top of the page, you'll find a menu that smoothly navigates you through current market offers and provides insights into both your past and active orders.
