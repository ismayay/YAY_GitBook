At YAY Network, our commitment is to present only the finest opportunities to our users. We take immense pride in ranking among the top three launchpads of 2023 and boasting one of the highest ROIs in the industry—even with the multitude of projects we've introduced to our users.&#x20;

This prestige isn't achieved overnight. Our meticulous Due Diligence process ensures that only the crème de la crème of start-ups are showcased to our cherished community. Our selective approach isn’t about exclusion but about prioritizing the trust our community places in us. Their unwavering support is the bedrock of our legacy.

**Wondering how to participate in our sales?**

Our community stands at the heart of everything we do. As a testament to this, we always offer them the first seat at the table. To be a part of our private sales rounds, owning and staking the YAY token is essential. You can [acquire](../how-to-acquire-yay-token/) $YAY Tokens on the BSC network via Pancake Swap and MEXC or on the Avalanche Network through Pangolin. Afterward, stake them at [https://yay.superlauncher.io/stake](https://yay.superlauncher.io/stake).

A minimum allocation starts at $100, necessitating a stake of at least 100K YAY tokens. In our pursuit of maintaining YAY Network's decentralization, allocations are distributed based on a ranking system, which might require a higher YAY stake for smaller allocations.&#x20;

To provide transparency and keep our community informed, we release regular leaderboard updates throughout the application phase.
