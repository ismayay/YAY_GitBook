After successful registration, navigating the platform is a breeze.&#x20;

The '**Deals**' page showcases all the ongoing fundraise deals available on the launchpad. To apply for any sale, simply ensure you have YAY tokens staked in the same wallet you've registered with, and register your intention to participate on this same page.

On the '**Portfolio**' page, you can seamlessly track all your investments facilitated through the YAY Network. This comprehensive overview provides details like the token name, allocation status, allocation size, tokens already claimed, the token's all-time high price, current live token price, the quantity of tokens yet to be unlocked, and the date of the next token distribution.

The final destination on the YAY Network Launchpad is the 'OTC' page. This is where you can sell any allocations you've acquired or purchase allocations from other users. This can be done pre-TGE, including with locked amounts.&#x20;

All transfers are automated, and the platform facilitates direct communication between sellers and buyers, allowing for negotiations on deal specifics.
