# How is $YAY Token Scalable?

The $YAY Token's scalability is firmly grounded in its meticulously crafted **tokenomics** and inherent **utility**. Its limited supply is a deliberate strategy, ensuring value retention and exclusivity. But what truly distinguishes the token is its role as a "**ticket**" to high-quality startups during their nascent stages—a unique proposition that we vouch to fulfill, by only delivering the most promissing protocols to our network of investors.

However, our commitment doesn't end here. To assure a regular revenue streamline for our holders, we're creating '**The Dividends Program**' which underpins our dedication to consistently reward our token holders.&#x20;

While fundraising remains a pivotal part of our operations, our ethos opposes becoming over-reliant on it, as that could inadvertently lead us to champion more projects than we're genuinely passionate about. Our core principle is to present only the crème de la crème of protocols to our community.&#x20;

This unwavering stance has led us to diversify our income streams. We've delved into marketing deals, fundraising partnerships, advisory tokens, design collaborations, and OTC market deals.&#x20;

Each venture reinforces our primary mission: to remain selective, staying true to our standards, while providing unparalleled value to our $YAY Token holders. We are ardently working towards implementing 'The Dividends Program' and aim to bring it to life as soon as conditions allow us to.
